Firewall</i></a>
<dd>by Peter N. M. Hansteen
<dd>ISBN-10: 1593271654
<dd>ISBN-13: 978-1593271657
<dd>December 2007, 184 pp.
<dd>
The first sentence of this book is, "<i>This is a book about building the 
network you need</i>". Taking it from there, Peter walks you through the whys 
and the hows of building the high performance, low maintenance network you need,
using OpenBSD tools.<br>
The book covers all bases from the basic one machine configuration and basic 
local area networks, all the way up to configurations with traffic shaping and 
load balancing with "self healing" networks and countermeasures against common 
problems such as DoS attempts and spamming.  A basic understanding of TCP/IP 
and some Unix knowledge is assumed.<br>

<i>The Design and Implementation of the 4.4 BSD Operating System</i>
<dd>by Marshal Kirk McKusick, Keith Bostic, Michael J. Karels, John S. Quarterman
<dd>
At 549 pages plus an index, <a href="http://www.awprofessional.com/title/0201549794">this book</a> must be considered comprehensive.
McKusick, Bostic and Karels are well known as prime movers at
Berkeley CSRG (Computer Systems Research Group) during the 4.3/4.4BSD
period. This book covers the 4.4 and 4.4-Lite releases, and discusses
everything you wanted to know about how the system operates.  Not
100% applicable, but probably the closest there is to an overall
system internals manual for OpenBSD.

<i>Source Code Secrets: The Basic 386BSD Operating System Reference
(Volume 1 of Operating System Source Code Secrets)</i>
<dd>by L. W. Jolitz, William Jolitz; 1997
<dd>
The Jolitzes built the first port of BSD to the PC-386 architecture,
and deserve a lot of credit for making BSD portable to this low-cost
architecture. The earliest versions, called "386bsd", were described
in articles in <em>Dr. Dobbs Journal</em>. This book goes beyond the articles,
and provides a comprehensive annotated collection of source code.
Not all of it applies to modern versions of OpenBSD, of course, but
you can still learn a lot from it.

<i>An Introduction to Berkeley Unix and ANSI C</i>

<i>4.4 BSD User's Reference Manual (URM)</i>
<dd>published by O'Reilly, 1994
<dd>
This is just a reprint of the man pages for users. 
Your OpenBSD distribution includes the online man pages,
which are specific to OpenBSD, and more up-to-date. So
you don't need this one: use the <em>man</em> command instead.

<i>4.4 BSD System Manager's Manual (SMM)</i>
<dd>published by O'Reilly, 1994
<dd>
This book details what you need to know to run a BSD system.
Quite a bit of this material is relevant to OpenBSD.
Unfortunately it is currently out of print.
Worse, due to licensing restrictions from AT&amp;T,
the electronic editions of these were not included in the
4.4BSD distributions, so most of them are not included with OpenBSD.

three freenix BSDs covering the essentials of installation, X configuration
and system administration, as well as PERL programming and tips on
LaTeX/Lyx. The book also covers the KDE desktop environment.
<br>Includes older versions of OpenBSD on the two included CD-ROMs. 
<br>Apparently not available through Amazon.com, but <a

<dt><i>UNIX Power Tools</i>
<dd>by Jerry D. Peek, Tim O'Reilly, and Mike Loukides
<dd>
This book is now in its third edition. It discusses
hundreds of neat tricks, little-known techniques, and add-on utilities.
Be aware that many of the utilities are either included with OpenBSD
or, more commonly, are already available as ports or packages.
So most of section 52.03, complaining about how hard it is to port
software to different UNIXes, can be disregarded if you learn about the
<a href="ports.html">Ports Mechanism</a>
that is part of OpenBSD.

<dt><i>Lions' Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition with Source Code</i>
<dd>by John Lions
<dd>
Although the UNIX described in this book is to BSD as a Model T Ford
is to a 70's Mustang or Thunderbird, UNIX inventor Ken Thompson
claims that "After 20 years, this is still the best exposition
of the workings of a 'real' operating system." Originally circulated
in illicit photocopies, this is the book that most first- and second-generation
UNIX hackers cut their code-teeth on. Recommended as a good introduction
to how a timesharing OS works, if you've not been inside one before.
Substantially shorter than the McKusick book above.

This is a very detailed and easy to read book.  It has several examples

system calls, and associated information so that you can use them.
This book along with the OpenBSD manual pages
make an excellent combination.

not how to use your compiler or anything else.

This book is not a tutorial (hence the title), it deals with syntax, data types,
ISO C library functions, and C/C++ compatibility.

From Amazon, someone commented "<i>
It is common to find that masters of mysterious technical arts are poor communicators. Bruce Schneier
demonstrates exceptional skill as a technical communicator. Here is a book about an esoteric subject - one
built on a foundation of theoretical mathematics - that ordinary folk can read. Sure, one needs to be
motivated by an interest in the subject, and the technical level sometimes requires a more than ordinary
background in number theory and the like - but a degree in theoretical mathematics is not necessary to
derive pleasure and profit from reading Applied Cryptography.</i>"
