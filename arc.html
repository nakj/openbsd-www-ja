<h2><font color="#e00000">OpenBSD/arc</font></h2>

<hr>

<p>
OpenBSD/arc runs on the machines compatible with the <i>Advanced RISC
Computing</i> specification, known as ARC machines, based on MIPS processors
and initially designed to run Microsoft Windows NT.
Such machines include the long dead Acer PICA, as well other machines
manufactured by other companies such as MIPS, Deskstation, NEC, and Olivetti.
</p>

<p>
The ARC specification is extinct, and no new ARC BIOS machines for MIPS will
likely be manufactured.
Microsoft has announced that it will no longer support MIPS after NT 4.0.
OpenBSD/arc used to provide a good alternative to NT.
</p>

<p>
<strong><font color="#e00000">The OpenBSD/arc port has been
discontinued</font></strong> after the 2.3 release.
</p>

<p>
There is currently no one working on bringing this port back to life.
The source code is still available in the CVS Attic, and code can be found in
NetBSD as well.
If you are interested in reviving the arc port, make it work and contact
<a href="mailto:pefo@openbsd.org">Per Fogelstr&ouml;m</a> and
<a href="mailto:imp@openbsd.org">Warner Losh</a>.

<h3><font color="#0000e0"><strong>History:</strong></font></h3>

<p>
The early history of this port is not very clear. Apparently the first work was
done by CMU as part of their Mach project. The initial hardware was the DEC
R2000/R3000-based DECstations. This code was later used by both the Sprite and
BSD groups. The 4.4BSD code, known as the <i><a href="pmax.html">pmax</a></i>
port, was made freely available in mid 1993. It was merged into the
NetBSD tree by a variety of people, but took several years to really become
stable and mature, mainly because of compiler toolchain problems.
</p>

<p>
Per Fogelstr&ouml;m became familiar with the code after porting it to a
home-built IDT R3081 based board. Subsequently he added R4400 support
when porting it to the MIPS R4400 Acer PICA board. Willowglen
Singapore purchased a second PICA board for Theo de Raadt so that he
could improve the port for use as a development system for an internal
project. Since then Theo, Per and others have completed the port.
</p>

<p>
As a result, the code has been modified to make it more versatile, and
eventually support a larger range of ARC machines. Unfortunately the death
of this platform, as well as the lack of general availability of this hardware,
eventually turned people away from working on this port. Eventually, it was
decided to stop supporting it and remove the code from the tree.
