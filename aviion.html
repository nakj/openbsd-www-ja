<p>
OpenBSD/aviion is an experimental port of OpenBSD to the Motorola 88100- and
88110-based AViiON systems manufactured by Data General.

<p>
A mailing list for m88k-based ports is available at
<u><font color="#23238e">m88k@openbsd.org</font></u>.
To join the OpenBSD/m88k mailing list, send a message body of
<b>"subscribe m88k"</b> to

Please be sure to check our <a href="mail.html">mailing list policy</a> before

<p>
The current port maintainer is Miod Vallat
(<a href="mailto:miod@openbsd.org">miod@openbsd.org</a>).
Others are definitely welcome to contribute!

<h3><font color="#0000e0"><strong>History:</strong></font></h3>

<p>
In September 2003, Chris Tribo published some excerpts of the technical
documentation for the AViiON series 400. Having a look at it, it was obvious
these systems were built upon a modified MVME188 design, already supported by
<a href="mvme88k.html">OpenBSD/mvme88k</a>, but there was no interest in working
on AViiON support at that time.

<p>
Then, late April 2006, enough boredom convinced Miod Vallat to start a port,
even though he did not have access to any AViiON hardware, as a challenge. In two
weeks, thanks to the help of Chris Tribo, a model 410 was running multiuser (but
diskless) - a proof that this effort was worth continuing inside the OpenBSD
tree. And work continues..

<hr>
<a name="status"></a>
<h3><font color="#0000e0"><strong>Current status:</strong></font></h3>

<p>
All supported models (or with similar designs) should run multi-user but
diskless, and currently limited to serial console.
Also, on multiprocessor machines, the system will currently run on one processor
only.

<hr>
<a name="projects"></a>
<h3><font color="#0000e0"><strong>Projects (in no particular order):
</strong></font></h3>

<ul>
  <li>On-board SCSI support on series 400 and compatible models.
  <li>Keyboard and video support.
  <li>Test on as many different models as possible.
  <li>Multiprocessor (SMP) support.
</ul>

<hr>
<a name="hardware"></a>
<h3><font color="#0000e0"><strong>Supported hardware:</strong></font></h3>

<h4>Supported machines</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>100, 200, 300, 400, 3000, 4000 and 4300 series</strong><br>
These are the machines initially targetted by this port.
Their design is close to the well-known MVME188 design, with different on-board
devices; at the moment only the on-board serial ports and ethernet are
supported.<br>
The only models tested so far are models 410 and 4300, but all the models in
this series should work.
</ul>

<h4>Untested machines</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>4600 and 530 series</strong><br>
These machines will be targeted soon as well. They are slightly different
from the above series, but not too many, and documentation is available.
The current code might already work to some extent.
</ul>

<h4>Unsupported machines</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>5000 and 6000 series</strong><br>
These machines may eventually run as well, but lack of on-board device support
could be a showstopper. Some documentation is available, but there hasn't been
any work towards supporting them yet.
<li><strong>6280 and 8000-8 series</strong><br>
Documentation is available, but there hasn't been any work towards supporting
them yet.
<li><strong>8500 and 9500 series, and other 88100-based models</strong><br>
These systems won't likely be supported unless documentation for them is found.
<li><strong>88110-based models (500, 4500, 5500, 8500+ and 9500+ series)</strong><br>
These systems won't likely be supported unless documentation for them is found.
</ul>
