<h3><font color="#0000e0">What's New</font></h3>
<p>
This is a partial list of new features and systems included in OpenBSD 3.2. 
For a comprehensive list, see the <a href="plus32.html">changelog</a> leading
to 3.2.
<p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.OpenSSH.com">OpenSSH</a> (supporting both the
SSH1 and SSH2 protocols) is now at version 3.5.  Privilege separation is
now enabled by default for greater robustness.
<p>

<li>Non-executable stack on i386, sparc, sparc64, alpha, powerpc.
No-exec data and bss on sparc, sparc64, and alpha.  This makes some
classes of future potential buffer overflows unexploitable.
<p>

<li>Apache runs chroot'd by default.  To disable this, see the new <b>-u</b>
option.
<p>

<li>A very significant reduction in setuid binaries.  Many of those binaries
which still retain setuid have been modified so the operations needing root
are done early on, and then privilege is revoked immediately after that.
<p>

<li>Asymmetric and symmetric hardware encryption support is now enabled by
default, if you have such devices in your machine.
<p>

<li>As usual, improvements to the documentation, notably the man pages and
the Web FAQ. A larger part of the website is now available in several
languages.
<p>

<li>More complete collection and better tested set of "ports".
setuid/setgid ports have been significantly reduced as well.  Many of the
ones that remain setuid have been modified to revoke privileges as early
as possible.
<p>

<li>Over 1800 pre-built and tested packages.
<p>

<li>Better video and X11 support for the
<a href="sparc.html">OpenBSD/sparc</a>,
<a href="sparc64.html">OpenBSD/sparc64</a> and
<a href="alpha.html">OpenBSD/alpha</a> ports.
<p>

<li>A lot of enhancements and stability improvements to our packet filter, <a
href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=pf&amp;sektion=4">pf</a>,
including:
<ul>
<li>new &quot;antispoof&quot; keyword: spoofing protection made easy
<li>much simplified rule file language
<li>extended filtering capabilities
<li>control state table entries on a per-rule granularity
<li>support dynamic interface expansion. No more need to reload the ruleset
    on IP changes.
</ul>
<p>

<li>A new tool,
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=systrace&amp;sektion=4">systrace</a>,
for controlling in detail applications behaviour and rights at the system call
level.
<p>

<li>The system includes the following major components from outside suppliers:
<p>
<ul>
<li>XFree86 4.2.1 (and i386 contains 3.3.X servers also, thus providing support for all chipsets)
<li>gcc 2.95.3 (+ patches)
<li>perl 5.6.1 (+ patches)
<li>Apache 1.3.26, mod_ssl 2.8.10, DSO support
<li>OpenSSL 0.9.7beta3 (+ patches)
<li>groff 1.15
<li>sendmail 8.12.6
<li>lynx 2.8.2rel.1 with HTTPS support added
<li>sudo 1.6.6
<li>ncurses 5.2
<li>Latest KAME IPv6
<li>KTH Kerberos 1.0.8
<li>Heimdal 0.4e (+ patches)
<li>OpenSSH 3.5
</ul>
<p>

<li>Many improvements for security and reliability (look for the red
print in the <a href="plus32.html">complete changelog</a>).

<h3><font color="#0000e0">How to install</font></h3>
<p>
Following this are the instructions which you would have on a piece of
paper if you had purchased a CDROM set instead of doing an alternate
form of install.  The instructions for doing an ftp (or other style
of) install are very similar; the CDROM instructions are left intact
so that you can see how much easier it would have been if you had
purchased a CDROM instead.
<p>

<hr>
Please refer to the following files on the three CDROMs for extensive
details on how to install OpenBSD 3.2 on your machine:
<p>
<ul>
<li>	CD1:3.2/i386/INSTALL.i386
<li>	CD1:3.2/alpha/INSTALL.alpha
<p>
<li>	CD2:3.2/macppc/INSTALL.macppc
<li>	CD2:3.2/vax/INSTALL.vax
<p>
<li>	CD3:3.2/sparc/INSTALL.sparc
<li>	CD3:3.2/sparc64/INSTALL.sparc64
</ul>
<hr>

<p>
Quick installer information for people familiar with OpenBSD, and the
use of the "disklabel -E" command.  If you are at all confused when
installing OpenBSD, read the relevant INSTALL.* file as listed above!
<p>

<h3><font color="#e00000">OpenBSD/i386:</font></h3>
<ul>
Play with your BIOS options to enable booting from a CD. The OpenBSD/i386
release is on CD1. If your BIOS does not support booting from CD, you will need
to create a boot floppy to install from. To create a boot floppy write
<i>CD1:3.2/i386/floppy32.fs</i> to a floppy and boot via the floppy drive.

<p>
Use <i>CD1:3.2/i386/floppyB32.fs</i> instead for greater scsi controller
support, or <i>CD1:3.2/i386/floppyC32.fs</i> for better laptop support.

<p>
If you are planning on dual booting OpenBSD with another OS, you will need to read the included INSTALL.i386 document.

<p>
To make a boot floppy under MS-DOS, use the &quot;rawrite&quot; utility located
at <i>CD:/3.2/tools/rawrite.exe</i>. To make the boot floppy under a Unix OS, use the <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=dd&amp;sektion=1">dd(1)</a> utility. The following is an example usage of <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=dd&amp;sektion=1">dd(1)</a>, where the device could be &quot;floppy&quot;, &quot;rfd0c&quot;, or &quot;rfd0a&quot;.

<ul><pre>
# <strong>dd if=&lt;file&gt; of=/dev/&lt;device&gt; bs=32k</strong>
</pre></ul>

<p>
Make sure you use properly formatted perfect floppies with NO BAD BLOCKS or your install will most likely fail. For more information on creating a boot floppy and installing OpenBSD/i386 please refer to <a href="faq/faq4.html#4.1">FAQ4.1</a>.
</ul>

<p>
<h3><font color="#e00000">OpenBSD/alpha:</font></h3>
<ul>
At the SRM prompt, enter <i>boot -fi 3.2/alpha/bsd.rd dka6</i> where <i>dka6</i>
is the short name for the CDROM drive (you can check with <i>show dev</i>).

<p>If you can't boot from CDROM, write <i>CD1:3.2/alpha/floppy32.fs</i> or
<i>CD1:3.2/alpha/floppyB32.fs</i> (depending on your machine) to a diskette and
enter <i>boot dva0</i>. Refer to INSTALL.alpha for more details.

<p>
Make sure you use a properly formatted floppy with NO BAD BLOCKS or your install will most likely fail.

</ul>

<p>
<h3><font color="#e00000">OpenBSD/macppc:</font></h3>
<ul>
Put the CD2 in your CDROM drive and poweron your machine while holding down the
<i>C</i> key until the display turns on and shows <i>OpenBSD/macppc boot</i>.

<p>
Alternatively, at the Open Firmware prompt, enter <i>boot cd:,ofwboot
/3.2/macppc/bsd.rd</i>
</ul>

<p>
<h3><font color="#e00000">OpenBSD/vax:</font></h3>
<ul>
Boot over the network via mopbooting as described in INSTALL.vax.
</ul>

<p>
<h3><font color="#e00000">OpenBSD/sparc:</font></h3>
<ul>
The 3.2 release of OpenBSD/sparc is located on CD3. To boot off of this CD you can use one of the two commands listed below, depending on the version of your ROM.

<ul><pre>
> <strong>boot cdrom 3.2/sparc/bsd.rd</strong>
or
> <strong>b sd(0,6,0)3.2/sparc/bsd.rd</strong>
</pre></ul>

<p>
If your sparc does not have a CD drive, you can alternatively boot from floppy.
To do so you need to write &quot;CD3:3.2/sparc/floppy32.fs&quot; to a floppy. For more information see <a href="faq/faq4.html#4.1">FAQ4.1</a>. To boot from the floppy use one of the two commands listed below, depending on the version of your ROM.

<ul><pre>
> <strong>boot floppy</strong>
or
> <strong>boot fd()</strong>
</pre></ul>

<p>
Make sure you use a properly formatted floppy with NO BAD BLOCKS or your install will most likely fail.

<p>
If your sparc doesn't have a floppy drive nor a CD drive, you can either
setup a bootable tape, or install via network, as told in the
INSTALL.sparc file.
</ul>

<p>
<h3><font color="#e00000">OpenBSD/sparc64:</font></h3>
<ul>
Put the CD3 in your CDROM drive and type <i>boot cdrom</i>.

<p>
If this doesn't work, or if you don't have a CDROM drive, you can write
<i>CD3:3.2/sparc64/floppy32.fs</i> to a floppy and boot it with <i>boot
floppy</i>.<br>
Make sure you use a properly formatted floppy with NO BAD BLOCKS or your install will most likely fail.

<p>
You can also write <i>CD3:3.2/sparc64/miniroot32.fs</i> to the swap partition on
the disk and boot with <i>boot disk:b</i>.

<p>
If nothing works, you can boot over the network as described in INSTALL.sparc64
</ul>

<p>
<h3><font color="#e00000">Notes about the source code:</font></h3>
<ul>
src.tar.gz contains a source archive starting at /usr/src.  This file
contains everything you need except for the kernel sources, which are
in a separate archive.  To extract:
<p>
<ul><pre>
# <strong>mkdir -p /usr/src</strong>
# <strong>cd /usr/src</strong>
# <strong>tar xvfz /tmp/src.tar.gz</strong>
</pre></ul>
<p>
srcsys.tar.gz contains a source archive starting at /usr/src/sys.
This file contains all the kernel sources you need to rebuild kernels.
To extract:
<p>
<ul><pre>
# <strong>mkdir -p /usr/src/sys</strong>
# <strong>cd /usr/src</strong>
# <strong>tar xvfz /tmp/srcsys.tar.gz</strong>
</pre></ul>
<p>
Both of these trees are a regular CVS checkout.  Using these trees it
is possible to get a head-start on using the anoncvs servers as
described at <a href="anoncvs.html">http://www.OpenBSD.org/anoncvs.html</a>.
Using these files
results in a much faster initial CVS update than you could expect from
a fresh checkout of the full OpenBSD source tree.
<p>
</ul>
<a name="ports"></a>
<hr>
<p>
<h3><font color="#0000e0">Ports Tree</font></h3>
<p>
A ports tree archive is also provided.  To extract:
<p>
<ul><pre>
# <strong>cd /usr</strong>
# <strong>tar xvfz /tmp/ports.tar.gz</strong>
# <strong>cd ports</strong>
</pre></ul>
<p>
The <i>ports/</i> subdirectory is a checkout of the OpenBSD ports tree.  Go
read <a href="ports.html">http://www.OpenBSD.org/ports.html</a>
if you know nothing about ports
at this point.  This text is not a manual of how to use ports.
Rather, it is a set of notes meant to kickstart the user on the
OpenBSD ports system.
<p>
Certainly, the OpenBSD ports system is not complete.  It is doubtful it
will ever be. However, it is growing very fast and getting more stable.
Almost all ports provided with this release should build without problems
on most architectures (over 2000 packages build on i386, for instance).
<p>
The <i>ports/</i> directory represents a CVS (see the manpage for 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=cvs&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=1&amp;manpath=OpenBSD+Current&amp;arch=i386&amp;format=html">
cvs(1)</a> if 
you aren't familiar with CVS) checkout of our ports.  As with our complete 
source tree, our ports tree is available via anoncvs.  So, in
order to keep current with it, you must make the <i>ports/</i> tree
available on a read-write medium and update the tree with a command
like:
<p>
<ul><pre>
# <strong>cd [portsdir]/; cvs -d anoncvs@server.openbsd.org:/cvs update -Pd -rOPENBSD_3_2</strong>
</pre></ul>
<p>
[Of course, you must replace the local directory and server name here
with the location of your ports collection and a nearby anoncvs
server.]
<p>
Note that most ports are available as packages through ftp. Updated
packages for the 3.2 release will be made available if problems arise.
<p>
If you're interested in seeing a port added, would like to help out, or just
would like to know more, the mailing list ports@openbsd.org is a good
place to know.
