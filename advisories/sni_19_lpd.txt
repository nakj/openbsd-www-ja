                          BSD lpd vulnerabilities


This advisory addresses a number of vulnerabilities present in the
BSD line printer daemon (lpd).  These vulnerabilities can enable a
remote individual to create and remove arbitrary files, as well as
enabling remote individuals to obtain shell access as the user
which lpd runs as.


Problem Descriptions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem 1: File creation

Individuals with access to the line printer daemon from a privileged
port on a valid print client can tell lpd to create a file, providing
the name of the file, including directory names, is no longer than 5
characters.

Problem 2: File deletion

Individuals with access to the line printer daemon from a privileged
port on a valid print client can tell lpd to remove any file on the
system.

Problem 3: Remote execution

Individuals with access to the line printer daemon from a privileged
port on a valid print client can execute commands remotely as the
user which lpd is running as.  This vulnerability can allow
interactive shell access to the remote system.


A privileged port on a valid client system is required to exploit
all of these vulnerabilities.  A privileged port can be obtained on
many operating systems by utilizing another vulnerability present in
the file transfer protocol daemon (ftpd).  This vulnerability is
commonly known as the "FTP bounce" attack, and allows data to be
sent to any internet address and port, originating from the FTP
data port (20).


Technical Details
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem 1: File creation

BSD derived lp daemons support a feature to allow remote print clients
to transfer control files and files to be printed, to the print server.
These files are created in the printer daemon spool directory.

This problem is present due to the fact that lpd fails to validate the
name of files being uploaded by print clients.  By specifying an explicit
path, an attacker can create files on a remote server.  This problem
allows an attacker to specify a total of 5 characters in the path
and name of the file.


Problem 2: File deletion

This problem uses the technique described in problem #1.  An attacker
has the ability to create lpd control files.  lpd control files support
various functions such as specifying a file to print and removal of
files.  Any file which is sent to the remote print daemon which begins
with "cf" will be treated as a control file.  By uploading a control
file which utilizes the removal feature, any system file can be
removed from the print server.


Problem 3: Remote Execution

This problem uses the technique described in problem #1.  By uploading
a lpd control file, the attacker can cause lpd to send mail to the
user specified in the control file, confirming their print job.  When
lpd sends mail, it specifies the username which was inserted into the
control file, on the sendmail command line.  By specifying a sendmail
command line option rather than a username, the attacker can cause
sendmail to utilize an alternate configuration file when it is invoked.

An alternate sendmail configuration file can be transferred to the
remote system via anonymous FTP, or Problem #1.


Impact
~~~~~~

If anonymous FTP is enabled on a valid print client, and the print
client is vulnerable to the FTP bounce attack, then individuals can
create and remove files on the print server, and execute commands on
the print server.

If anonymous FTP is not enabled on any print client, but the FTP
server is vulnerable to the FTP bounce attack, then any user with
a valid FTP account can create and remove files on the print server,
and execute commands on the print server.

If no valid print clients are vulnerable to the FTP bounce attack, then
a user with root privileges on any valid print client can create and
remove files on the print server, and execute commands on the print
server.


Vulnerable Systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

BSD/OS 2.1 and 3.0 (BSDI):

  The BSD/OS print system is not configured by default, therefore
  all vulnerabilities apply ONLY if the system has been configured
  as a print server.

  The BSD/OS lpd is vulnerable to all three problems if printing
  has been enabled.

  The lpd shipped with BSD/OS accepts connections from the FTP
  daemon, allowing attackers to utilize the FTP bounce attack.

  BSD/OS is vulnerable to problem 3 (remote execution) only if
  the attacker has the ability to upload a world readable file
  to the remote server.


FreeBSD:

  The FreeBSD print system is not configured by default, therefore
  all vulnerabilities apply ONLY if the system has been configured
  as a print server.

  In 2.1.7 and 2.2.2, the ftpd shipped does NOT permit the ftp
  bounce attack.

  In 2.1.7 and 2.2.2, the lpd shipped does not permit connections from
  the FTP daemon.

  Current versions of FreeBSD are vulnerable only if the attacker has
  super-user access on a valid print client.


Linux:

  Many Linux distributions have lpd configured by default and
  permit "localhost" to use the print service.

  The Linux lpd is vulnerable to all three problems if printing
  has been enabled.

  The lpd shipped with Linux accepts connections from the FTP
  daemon, allowing attackers to utilize the FTP bounce attack.

  The ftpd shipped with some Linux versions permits the FTP bounce
  attack.  To determine your ftpd version, issue the command:

  % telnet localhost 21

  If you see: 'wu-ftpd-2.4.2-academ[BETA-13]' then you are NOT
  vulnerable to FTP bounce attacks.  If you do not see
  'academ[BETA-13]' in the ftpd version string, then there is
  a high possibility that you are vulnerable to FTP bounce attacks.

  Linux is vulnerable to problem 3 (remote execution) only if
  the attacker has the ability to upload a world readable file
  to the remote print server.


OpenBSD 2.1:

  The OpenBSD print system is not enabled by default.

  The OpenBSD lpd does not permit connections from the FTP daemon.

  OpenBSD ftpd is not vulnerable to ftp bounce attacks.

  OpenBSD is vulnerable only if the attacker has super-user access
  to a valid print client.

  OpenBSD is vulnerable to problem 3 (remote execution) only if
  the attacker has the ability to upload a world readable file
  to the remote print server.

  OpenBSD-current has all of the above problems fixed.


Fix Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are several solutions which can serve as a workaround for this
problem.

i.   Installing a FTP daemon which prevents ftp bounce.  This FTP
     daemon should be installed on all print clients to prevent non-root
     users from obtaining a privileged port to connect to the print
     daemon with.

     A freely available FTP daemon which prevents users from sending
     data to privileged ports is the Academ wu-ftpd variant, currently
     in beta.

     You can obtain a copy of this ftpd at:

     ftp://ftp.academ.com/pub/wu-ftpd/private/wu-ftpd-2.4.2-beta-15.tar.Z

     Installing this alternate FTP daemon will limit the above attacks,
     however will still allow an attacker who has super-user access on
     a valid print client to exploit these problems.

ii.  Modify your print daemon to reject connections from the ftp-data
     port (port 20).

iii. Disable print services until a suitable fix has been made available
     for your operating system.

iv.  Install a fixed version of the BSD print software.  A fixed version
     of the BSD print software is available at the following ftp site:

     ftp://ftp.secnet.com/pub/patches/lpd.tar.gz

     This package fixes numerous other problems present in the BSD
     printing suite, including numerous buffer overflows present in both
     the client programs and the server.  This package has been
     provided by OpenBSD.

v.   Contact your vendor for patch information.
