<hr>

<h3><font color="#0000e0"><a name=cdrom>Purchase/download a
  CD-ROM</a></font></h3>

<p>
The best way to get an OpenBSD release (<i>-release</i>) and support us
is to buy a 3-CD set. More information is available on our
<a href="orders.html">ordering page</a>.

<p>
If you choose not to buy an OpenBSD CD-ROM, you can also install
OpenBSD with a CDROM you burn yourself. To achieve this, you have to
download one of the following ISO files from our <a
href="ftp.html">mirrors</a>:

<ul>
	<li><i>cd44.iso</i> to burn a minimal 4.4 CDROM
	  (roughly 5MB in size, boot only)</li>
	<li><i>install44.iso</i> to burn a full 4.4 CDROM
	  (roughly 200MB in size, boot + sets)</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you choose <i>cd44.iso</i>, you will need to get the base and X sets
via another media or network. Otherwhise, if you choose
<i>install44.iso</i>, you will not need anything but the <a
href="faq/faq15.html">application packages</a>.

<p>
Note that the paragraph above is also valid for the people interested by
running <i>-current</i>. You can fetch <i>install44.iso</i> from the
latest snapshot and install or upgrade your system very quickly.

<h3><font color="#0000e0"><a name=mirrors>Download via
  FTP/HTTP/AFS/RSYNC</a></font></h3>

<p>
OpenBSD can be also easily installed via FTP. Typically you need a
single small piece of boot media (e.g., a boot floppy) and then the rest
of the files can be installed from a number of locations, including
directly off the Internet. Follow this simple set of instructions to
ensure that you find all of the documentation you will need while
performing an install via FTP. With the CD-ROMs, the necessary
documentation is easier to find.

<h3>1 - Choose a mirror</h3>

<p>
Read either of the following two files for a list of ftp mirrors which
provide OpenBSD, then choose one near you:

<ul>
	<li><a href="ftp.html">http://www.OpenBSD.org/ftp.html</a></li>
	<li><a href="ftp://ftp.OpenBSD.org/pub/OpenBSD/4.4/ftplist"
	  >ftp://ftp.OpenBSD.org/pub/OpenBSD/4.4/ftplist</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>2 - Connect to the mirror</h3>

<p>
Connect to that ftp mirror site and go into the directory
pub/OpenBSD/4.4/ which contains these files and directories. This is a
list of what you should see:

<pre>
        ANNOUNCEMENT    amd64/          macppc/         sparc/
        Changelogs/     armish/         mvme68k/        sparc64/
        HARDWARE        ftplist         mvme88k/        src.tar.gz
        PACKAGES        hp300/          packages/       sys.tar.gz
        PORTS           hppa/           ports.tar.gz    tools/
        README          i386/           root.mail       vax/
        SIZES           landisk/        sgi/            xenocara.tar.gz
        alpha/          mac68k/         socppc/         zaurus/
</pre>

<p>
It is quite likely that you will want AT LEAST the following files which
apply to all the architectures OpenBSD supports. 

<pre>
        README          - generic README
        HARDWARE        - list of hardware we support
        PORTS           - description of our "ports" tree
        PACKAGES        - description of pre-compiled packages
        root.mail       - a copy of root's mail at initial login.
                          (This is really worthwhile reading).
</pre>

<p>
Read the <i>README</i> file. It is short, and a quick read will make
sure you understand what else you need to fetch.

<h3>3 - Choose the installation method</h3>

<p>
Next, go into the directory that applies to your architecture, for
example, <i>i386</i>. You should see something similar to the
following:

<pre>
        INSTALL.i386    cd44.iso        floppyB44.fs    pxeboot*
        INSTALL.linux   cdboot*         floppyC44.fs    xbase44.tgz
        MD5             cdbr*           game44.tgz      xetc44.tgz
        base44.tgz      cdemu44.iso     index.txt       xfont44.tgz
        bsd*            comp44.tgz      install44.iso   xserv44.tgz
        bsd.mp*         etc44.tgz       man44.tgz       xshare44.tgz
        bsd.rd*         floppy44.fs     misc44.tgz
</pre>

<p>
Many ways to perform a new installation are available on our mirrors and
you will have to choose one of the following methods:

<ul>
	<li>CDROM -- use the install44.iso files and burn a CDR</li>
	<li>Floppy -- write the floppy*44.fs files to a floppy</li>
	<li>Network protocols (<i>PXE</i>, <i>MOP</i>, etc.) -- see
	    INSTALL.* for details</li>
	<li>etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Consult the <a href="faq/faq4.html">Installation Guide</a> to get an
exhaustive list of the different ways to install OpenBSD, and learn how
to make a bootable OpenBSD install media.
