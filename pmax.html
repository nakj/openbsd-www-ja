<hr>

<p>
OpenBSD/pmax runs on a large set of the Digital MIPS-based DECstation and
DECserver family. These machines were the counterpart of the <a
href="vax.html">VAX-based VAXstations</a>,
until the <a href="alpha.html">Alpha</a> line was ready.
</p>

<p>
<strong><font color="#e00000">The OpenBSD/pmax port has been
discontinued</font></strong> after the 2.7 release.
</p>

<p>
There is currently no one working on bringing this port back to life.
The source code is still available in the CVS Attic, and code can be found in
NetBSD as well.
If you are interested in reviving the pmax port, make it work and contact
<a href="mailto:millert@openbsd.org">Todd Miller</a> and
<a href="mailto:miod@openbsd.org">Miod Vallat</a>.

<h3><font color="#0000e0"><strong>History:</strong></font></h3>

<p>
The pmax port of OpenBSD was started by Thomas Graichen shortly before the
OpenBSD 2.0 release, based on the NetBSD/pmax sources. It was then slowly
brought in shape, becoming self-hosted, and moving to ECOFF, then ELF
binaries.
</p>

<p>
A few releases later, Thomas Graichen stopped working on this port, and
nobody stepped in. The port was slowly left in oblivion, with no new code and
hardly any bugfixes, although releases were still being made.
</p>

<p>
A timid effort was made after the 2.7 release to revive the port, but
MIPS-specific toolchain problems prevented the system from building itself for a
long time, and development went on hiatus again. When the problem was finally
fixed, it was decided however to stop supporting it and remove the code from the
tree.
