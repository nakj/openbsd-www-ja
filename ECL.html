<h1>Export Control List </h1>
The Canadian Export Control List controls the export of goods from Canada.  Goods on the list require a license from the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  It is promulgated under the authority of the Export and Import Control Act of Canada.
<p> The following are excerpts from that List regarding the export of Cryptography from Canada.

These are taken from the pamphlet titled <b>A Guide to Canada's Export Controls</b> available from 
<a href=http://axion.physics.ubc.ca/ECL-locn.html>International Trade Centers of the Gov't of Canada </a> across the country.


<p>The following excerpts are taken from the Guide.

<p> <h3> 1000. General Technology Note</h3>
<p>
The export of "technology" which is "required" for the "development", "production" or "use" of a products embargoes in the  International Industrial List is controlled according to the provisions in each Category.
<p> "Technology" "required" for the "development", "production" or "use" of a product under embargo remains under embargo even when applicable to any unembargoed product.
<p> Controls do not apply to that "technology" which is the minimum necessary for the installation, operation, maintenance, (checking) and repair of those products which are unembargoed or whose export has been authorised.<br>
<b> N.B.</b><br>
This does not release the repair "technology" embargoed by Category 1085.2.a Controls do not apply to "technology" "in the public domain" or to "basic scientific research".
<a name=exempt><p><b>General "Software" Note</b></a><br>
This List does not embargo "software" which is either"<br>
<ol type=a>
<li> Generally available to the public by being:

<dl><dt>"In the public domain"
             <dd>As it applies to the International Lists, means "technology" or "software" which has been made available without restrictions upon its further dissemination.<br>
<b> N.B.</b><br>
<i>Copyright restrictions do not remove "technology" or "software" from being "in the public domain".</i>
     
<dt> "Software"
<dd>A collection of one or more "programmes" or "microprogrammes" fixed in any tangible medium of expression.
<dt> "Technology"
     <dd>Specific information necessary for the "development", "production" 
or "use" of a product. The information takes the form of "technical data" 
or "technical assistance". Embargoed "technology" is defined in the 
General Technology Note and in the International Industrial List.<br>
<b>N.B.</b><br>
<ol><li> "Technical data" may take forms such as blueprints, plans, diagrams, models, formulae, tables, engineering designs and specifications, manuals and instructions written or recorded on other media or devices such as disk, tape, read-only memories.

<h2><a name=US>Group 5- Miscellaneous Goods</a></h2>
<center> .<br>.<br>.<br></center>
<h3> United States Origin Goods</h3>
<p><b>
5400. All goods that originate in the United States, unless they are 
included elsewhere in this List, whether in bond or cleared by 
Canadian Customs, other than goods that have been further 
processed or manufactured outside the United States so as to 
result in a substantial change in value, form or use of the 
goods or in the production of new goods.
</b><br>


<p>  With respect to this section, an introductory note in the Forward to  the Guide states:
<ul>
<h3> Re-export of United States Origin Goods</h3>
United States origin goods are controlled for re-export from Canada under 
Item 5400 of Group . Although this means that all non-strategic 
U.S. origin goods require an export permit, exporters may benefit,
 in most cases, from the provisions of General Export Permit No. Ex. 12 
Canadian exporters of U.S. origin goods should be aware that depending 
upon the nature of the goods and the country of destination, exporters 
may be required to provide a copy of a U.S. export license or 
verification that such goods may be exported to the specified country 
without the U.S. license, prior to issuance of a Canadian export permit. 
Contact the Export Controls Division for more information.
