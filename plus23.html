<h2><font color="#e00000">Changes made between OpenBSD 2.2 and OpenBSD 2.3</font></h2>
<hr>

<p>
This is a partial list of the major machine independent changes
(i.e., these are the changes people ask about most often).  Machine
specific changes have also been made, and are sometimes mentioned
in the pages for the specific <a href=plat.html>platforms</a> if you
are interested in further port-specific details.  Many ports
have had architecture-specific enhancements relative to NetBSD,
but when they do not they certainly have plenty of platform-independent
changes, starting with those listed below..

<p>
Note: <font color="#e00000">Problems for which patches exist are marked in red</font>.

<ul>
<li><font color="#e00000"><strong>A security problem due to buffer mismanagement exists in lprm(1). <a href="errata22.html#rmjob">A patch exists</a></strong></font>.
<li><font color="#e00000"><strong>A security problem due to a buffer overflow exists in uucpd(8) (which is not enabled by default in our releases). <a href="errata22.html#uucpd">A patch exists</a></strong></font>.
<li>On the i386, fix installboot(8) so it works reliably on various filesystem layouts that did not work before.
<li>Support lots of file descriptors in named(8), for when many virtual interfaces exist.
<li>Fix installboot(8) on the sparc Sun4 models.
<li>In disklabel(8)'s <strong>-E</strong> mode, set the bootblock sizes so that the hp300 install does not freak out.
<li>In mktemp(3), repair a bug in the filename incrementing loop.
<li>Various other install script fixes.
<li>Fix /etc/fbtab handling in init(8).
<li>Make disklabel(8) mentions IDE (which is an alias for ESDI).
<li>For the i386, have the install procedure ask if the xf86 driver should be enabled by default. 
<li>Make install procedure prompt &amp; set the initial root password.
<li>When root logs in for the first time, let him find that he has an interesting piece of mail about how the system works.
<li>Fix ipsec encap notifies.
<li>Configure xdm(1) and the fwvm window manager sensibly enough for default users to not feel utterly lost.
<li>Fix 'u'ndo support in disklabel(8)'s <strong>-E</strong> mode, and also add a new 'r' command.
<li>Repair the pkg_add(1) sufficiently for the 2.3 release...
<li>Fix a race condition in unmount(2). 
<li>Add support for the XR16850 serial chip (128 byte fifos).
<li>mkisofs 1.11.2
<li>Disable console ddb by default.  sysctl can re-enable it.
<li>Fix backtraces in gdb on m68k platforms.
<li>Support 3c905B (well, actually, our support falls over. We need a card to do further work).
<li>Modify i386 PS/2 driver to be read/write; this permits new XFree86 source to put mice into advanced modes of operation.
<li>Remove KTH Kerberos "eavesdropping" message from telnet(1) and telnetd(8).
<li>Fix bug oflow in ping(8) <strong>-R</strong> option.

<li>Fixes for various (minor) Y2K problems.
<li>Switch a.out ports in the tree (sparc, m68k, i386) to use the newer version of gdb that is part of the binutils tree.
<li>Significantly improve the system install scripts.
<li>Add disklabel spoofing to the hp300 port.
<li>Add xlockmore(1) to the X11 tree.
<li>Fix <strong>ru_majflt</strong> counting in the VM system.
<li>Add AFS token fetching capability to various parts of the source tree.
<li>In login(1), handle cleanup of environment variables correctly.
<li>In ftp(1), for HTTP requests pass the hostname so that virtual hosts work.
<li>In utimes(2) and futimes(2), handle <strong>tv_sec</strong> values of -1 more carefully, as they are really illegal cases.
<li>Import <strong>kx</strong> into our X11 source tree.
<li>Add a <strong>SIOCGIFDATA</strong> ifreq-style ioctl which will get the ifdata informational structure attached to each interface.
<li>Add httpd(8) to the OpenBSD tree.  It is apache 1.2.6.
<li>Import <strong>xpm</strong> into our X11 source tree.
<li>Support QLogic PCI scsi controllers (at least on the i386).
<li>Fix rmd160(3) (and also the IPSEC algorithm) to properly handle data beyond its block boundary.
<li>Emulate SunOS <strong>otimes(2)</strong> system call so that Netscape doesn't explode.
<li>Fix rarpd(8) interaction with routed(8); too much routing information would pile up un-read on the AF_ROUTE socket and rarpd(8) would get too grumpy.
<li>Remove libtelnet.so.* from the distribution.  People compiling kerberos into their system were generating significantly different shared libraries; thus it is wrong to make this a shared library.
<li>Make edquota(8) handle numeric names as uids only after checking that an account named so does not exist.
<li>Add UID_MAX and GID_MAX to &lt;machine/limits.h&gt; on each architecture.

<li>On the sparc, switch to an alternate font if the console is &lt; 800*600 resolution.
<li>Add ISAPNP driver for the 3c509 cards.
<li>Change <strong>SIOCGIFNETMASK</strong>, <strong>SIOCGIFDSTADDR</strong>, and <strong>SIOCGIFBRDADDR</strong> to return information for named/addressed mappings rather than simply named mappings, so that these calls can work on interface aliases.
<li>Add (complete?) support for KerberosIV to our X11R6.
<li>In mktemp(1), document why this should be used for temporary filename generation. 
<li>In telnet(1), fix connecting to IP addresses; this was recently broken by the new KTH kerberos telnet integration.
<li>Make <strong>-R path</strong> work a well as <strong>-Rpath</strong> in cc(1).
<li>In the ksh(1) manpage, clarify the behaviour of the <strong>CDPATH</strong> variable.
<li>Add support for more PCI NE2000 cards.

<li>Make the functions described in ethers(3) more careful.
<li>Fix support for VFS loadable kernel modules.
<li>In get*ent() family of routines in libc, use fgetln(3) instead of fgets(3) so that parsing of overly long lines is more correct.
<li>Add options(4).  This manpage describes what all the kernel options do.  If you spot an error in it, notify us immediately.
<li>In strptime(3), make <strong>%C</strong> influence <strong>%y</strong> regardless of ordering.
<li>Fix a NULL deference bug in make(1) when using the <strong>-j</strong> flag.
<li>Fix <strong>%m</strong>, <strong>%I</strong>, <strong>%S</strong>, <strong>%y</strong>, <strong>%C</strong>, and <strong>%j</strong>  conversions in strptime(3).
<li>Merge Kirk McKusick's <a href="faq/faq14.html#14.5">soft update</a> code. This code is still experimental and under a non-commercial license.  It will be included in the next release as an optional compile flag; we cannot ship it enabled by default.
<li>Flesh out the man pages and explain the security problems behind mktemp(3) and other similar functions, plus explain how to handle these problems better.
<li>Fully working KerberosIV encryption in telnet(1) and telnetd(8).
<li>Fixes to a few more games.
<li>CVS version 1.9.26
<li>Fix mktemp(3) problems in two more YP tools.
<li>Fix an interaction bug in inetd(8) due to SIGPIPE blocking; caused a bad effect in rlogind(8) or other inetd(8) children.
<li>Configure cc(1) to pass the <strong>-R</strong> flag on to ld(1).
<li>Add lynx 2.8 to the system.
<li>Add support for 82553 and 82555B PHY in the fxp driver.
<li>Fix tmpfile(3) to fchown() the file after unlink() (taking umask() into consideration, too).  This is required by standards.
<li>Fix vnd and ccd drivers to work properly with soft updates.
<li>Fix a crash case in compress(1).
<li>Add <strong>-s</strong> and <strong>-c</strong> options to last(1).
<li>Add support for <strong>-s section</strong> and <strong>-S subsection</strong> to man(1).
<li>Change the configuration of man(1) so that man4 is read much later; this makes it easier to see pages in man8 with similar names.

<li>Correct behaviour <strong>-x</strong> and <strong>-p</strong> flags in tar(1) to be traditional.
<li>Remove one of the two copies of math.h in the source tree.
<li>Improve blowfish performance by a factor of 2, and hence increase the rounds by 1 in passwd.conf.
<li>Handle unknown hostnames in mountd(8) better.
<li>Inside the kernel, change struct file's members f_count and f_msgcount to longs, and then add checking for overflows as well.
<li>Add XDM-AUTHORIZATION to X11.

<li>Make the kernel compile properly (with full warnings) under gcc 2.8.
<li><font color="#e00000"><strong>Do not permit a read+write mmap() operation on a read-only file descriptor open on a device.  This is a security problem in OpenBSD 2.2, and is <a href="errata22.html#mmap"> described and fixed with a patch</a></strong></font>.
<li>Rename /etc/nat.rules to /etc/ipnat.rules.
<li>Add kerberos kauthd(8).
<li>On the i386, move XFree86 aperture driver into the kernel.  The new sysctl(8) variable <strong>machdep.allowaperture</strong> decides if this driver is active or not.  (This variable can only be modified at high securelevel).
<li>Remove the ftp(1) `stdout redirection' hack and replace it with a <strong>-o filename</strong> option (which also understands a filename of "-" to mean stdout).
<li>Pull in all the NetBSD changes to the old version of gas over the last year or so.
