<h2><font color="#e00000"><strong>Products based on
    OpenBSD</strong></font></h2>

<p>
The following products are based on OpenBSD:
<ul>

<li><font color="#e00000"><strong>RTMX</strong></font><br>
<a href="http://www.rtmx.com">RTMX</a> sells a version of OpenBSD which
has a full complement of POSIX real-time features added to it. They have
graciously donated the source code for these extensions, and these
changes will be integrated into OpenBSD soon.
<p>

<li><font color="#e00000"><strong>syscall Network Solutions</strong></font><br>
<a href="http://www.syswall.de/">Syscall Network Solutions</a>
produces the <em>syswall</em> security appliance based on OpenBSD. The
syswall Security Appliance contains a stateful packet-filtering
firewall, an intrusion detection system and VPN capabilities even with
dynamic IP addresses. It was specifically designed for Managed Security
Services and Managed Security Monitoring offered by our IT Security
Experts. It is also possible to use the syswall as DSL or cable router
as it supports PPPoE and DHCP.
<p>

<li><font color="#e00000"><strong>GeNUA</strong></font><br>
<a href="http://www.genua.de/">GeNUA mbH</a>,
a company based in Munich, Germany, offers sophisticated IT security
solutions based on OpenBSD:
The two-tier GeNUGate system is the only firewall certified by the
German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) at E3 / high level
under the ITSEC international standard.
<br>
In 2006, the GeNUGate has been re-certified using the newer Common Criteria
international standard at the level EAL4 augmented by the assurance components
AVA_VLA.4 and ALC_FLR.2.
<br>
The crypto appliance GeNUBox was
developed for remote control of machines via the Internet. Among others,
an important function of this GeNUA product is to set up SSH-encrypted
tunnels for data transmission via the Internet and to provide an
integrated application platform.
<p>

<a href="http://www.gtgi.com">Global Technologies Group, Inc.</a> 
produces <a href="http://www.powercrypt.com">PowerCrypt</a>, an
intelligent, bus-mastering PCI board that incorporates the Hifn 7751

substantially spiffed-up commercial version of the OpenBSD/i386 audio

drivers OpenBSD/i386 ships with, but they support many additional cards
and take full advantage of these cards' features. <a

configured through a web interface to generate reports on the fly, using
very little CPU time. (Upon request, Core may be able to provide InSite
for platforms other then i386.)
