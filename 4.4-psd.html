<h1>4.4BSD Programmer's Supplementary Documents (PSD)</h1>

<h2>Documents of Historical Interest</h2>

<h3>The Unix Time-Sharing System</h3>

Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson's original paper about UNIX, reprinted 
from Communications of the ACM.

<h3>Unix Implementation</h3>

Ken Thompson's description of the implementation of the Version 7
kernel and file system.

<h3>The Unix I/O System</h3>

Dennis Ritchie's overview of the I/O System of Version 7; still helpful for 
those writing device drivers.

<h3>Unix Programming - Second Edition</h3>

Describes the programming interface to the UNIX version 7 operating
system and the standard I/O library.  Should be supplemented by
Kernighan and Pike, ``The UNIX Programming Environment'',
Prentice-Hall, 1984 and especially by the Programmer Reference Manual
section 2 (system calls) and 3 (library routines).

<h3><a href="ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/src/share/doc/psd/05.sysman">Berkeley Software Architecture Manual (4.4 Edition)</a></h3>

A concise and terse description of the system call interface
provided in Berkeley Unix, as revised for 4.4BSD.
This will never be a best seller.

<h2>Languages in common use</h2>

<h3>The C Programming Language - Reference Manual</h3>

Official statement of the syntax of C.
Should be supplemented by ``The C Programming Language,''
B.W. Kernighan and D.M. Ritchie, Prentice-Hall, 1978, that
contains a tutorial introduction and many examples.

<h3>Berkeley Pascal User's Manual</h3>

An implementation of this language popular for learning to program.

<h3>A Portable Fortran 77 Compiler</h3>

A revised version of the document which originally appeared in
Volume 2b of the Bell Labs documentation;
this version reflects the work done at Berkeley.

<h3>Introduction to the f77 I/O Library</h3>

A description of the revised input/output library for Fortran 77, 
reflecting work carried out at Berkeley.

<h2>Programming Tools</h2>

<h3>Debugging with GDB: The GNU Source-Level Debugger</h3>

How to debug programs using the source level <b>gdb</b> debugger
(or how to debug programs without having to know much about machine language).

<h3>A Tutorial Introduction to ADB</h3>

How to debug programs using the assembly-language level <b>adb</b> debugger.

<h3>Make - A Program for Maintaining Computer Programs</h3>

Indispensable tool for making sure large programs are properly
compiled with minimal effort. 

<h3>An Introduction to the Revision Control System</h3>

RCS is a user-contributed tool for working together with other people
without stepping on each other's toes.
An alternative to <b>sccs</b> for controlling software changes.

<h3>An Introduction to the Source Code Control System</h3>

A useful introductory article for those users with
installations licensed for SCCS.

<h3>YACC: Yet Another Compiler-Compiler</h3>

Converts a BNF specification of a language and semantic actions
written in C into a compiler for that language.

<h3>LEX - A Lexical Analyzer Generator</h3>

Creates a recognizer for a set of regular expressions:
each regular expression can be followed by arbitrary C code
to be executed upon finding the regular expression.

<h3>The M4 Macro Processor</h3>

M4 is a macro processor useful in its own right and as a
front-end for C, Ratfor, and Cobol.

<h3>gprof: a Call Graph Execution Profiler</h3>

A program to show the call graph and execution time of a program.
Indispensable aid for improving the running time of almost everything.

<h2>Programming Libraries</h2>

<h3>Screen Updating and Cursor Movement Optimization</h3>

Describes the <b>curses</b> package, an aid for writing screen-oriented,
terminal-independent programs.

<h2>General Reference</h2>

<h3><a href="ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/src/share/doc/psd/20.ipctut">An Introductory 4.4BSD Interprocess Communication Tutorial</a></h3>

How to write programs that use the Interprocess Communication Facilities
of 4.4BSD.

<h3><a href="ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/src/share/doc/psd/21.ipc">An Advanced 4.4BSD Interprocess Communication Tutorial</a></h3>

The reference document (with some examples) for the Interprocess Communication 
Facilities of 4.4BSD.
